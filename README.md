# Web Services

# Synopisis

Xynga-Web-Services is an Angular 4 library that is made up of injectable services that are easy to implement and utilize in any Angular application. Web services include making HTTP calls, Idle services and notifications, and file upload/download functionality. 

# Motivation

Xynga-Web-Services is one of the 7 Xynga libraries. Each of the 7 libraries are made up of components, services, and directives that were originally developed for Vertex's Country-By-Country Reporting application. They were repackaged under the Xynga name and published on npm so that they could be made available to anyone that wishes to use them in their Angular 4 application.

# Installation

To install Xynga-Web-Services, run the command <code>npm install xynga-web-services</code> from the Angular project directory that you wish to install the library to. It will then be available in the project's <code>node_modules</code> directory. All of Xynga-Web-Services' third party dependencies will be automatically downloaded and placed in the project's <code>node_modules</code> directory as well. Then, simply import <code>ServiceModule</code> (from 'xynga-web-services') to the appropriate module in the project. <br/>

Additionally, it is important that <code>"types" : ["node"]</code> and <code>"typeRoots" : ["../node_modules/@types"]</code> are added to the <code>"compilerOptions"</code> array in the project's tsconfig.app.json file, or else the project might not compile properly.
